# Excel Sales Dashboard Project
I developed a comprehensive Excel dashboard to visualize and manage sales data, providing key insights and predictions to support business decision-making as a medical representative. This tool is being used by all medical representatives.

2. Orders Page: Simplifies the entry of sales data, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
3. Customers Page: Maintains detailed records of customer information for better relationship management.
4. Products Page: Keeps track of product information, enabling efficient inventory management.
